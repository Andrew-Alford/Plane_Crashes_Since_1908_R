# Plane_Crashes_Since_1908_R

### Introduction
In today's modern world, airplanes are the most common mode of transportation.  A single airplane crash can lead to significant losses.  This report presents the findings of the airplane crashes and fatalities dataset with approximately 5,000
incidents from 1908 to 2019. The purpose of this report is to uncover and extract patterns to provide actionable insights. To
gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, our team performed data cleansing, munging, and visualization techniques.
Additionally, we performed text mining to identify the most common reasons for crashes from the summary section of the
dataset. As a result of our analyses, our team will provide actionable insights into the crashes so they can be studied further
to prevent future accidents.

### Research Questions/Analyses:
1. How have plane crashes varied over time?
2. Which airline operator has the most crashes?
3. How have crashes varied between civilian and military over time?
4. What are the most common reasons for the crashes?
5. What US states have seen the most crashes over time?
6. How have fatalities varied over time? Is safety improving?

### Main Conclusions
* The main causes of crashes were weather related events, engine failure, and pilot (crew) errors.
* While crashes and fatalities are tragic events, based on an exponential growth in passenger volume since 1980, safety has dramatically increased.
* Civilian airlines crash more often than military air forces, and Aeroflot has significantly more crashes than other operators.
* Given its small population, Alaska has the 2nd most crashes just below California (the state with the highest population).
* The bottom line is don't fly in Alaska during the winter on Aeroflot, especially if there is inclement weather forecasted.
