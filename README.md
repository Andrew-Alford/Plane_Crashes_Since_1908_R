# Plane_Crashes_Since_1908_R

## Introduction
In today's modern world, airplanes are the most common mode of transportation.  A single airplane crash can lead to significant losses.  This report presents the findings of the airplane crashes and fatalities dataset with approximately 5,000
incidents from 1908 to 2019. The purpose of this report is to uncover and extract patterns to provide actionable insights. To
gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, our team performed data cleansing, munging, and visualization techniques.
Additionally, we performed text mining to identify the most common reasons for crashes from the summary section of the
dataset. As a result of our analyses, our team will provide actionable insights into the crashes so they can be studied further
to prevent future accidents.
